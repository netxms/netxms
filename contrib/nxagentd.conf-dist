#
# Sample configuration file for NetXMS agent
#

#
# Servers
#
# List of management servers which have read access to this agent.
# Both IP addresses and DNS names can be used. Multiple servers can be
# specified in one line, separated by commas. If this parameter used more
# than once, servers listed in all occurences will have access to agent.
#
# Examples:
# Servers = 10.0.0.1
# Servers = 127.0.0.1, srv1.domain.com, srv2.domain.com

#
# ControlServers
#
# List of management servers which can execute actions on agent. Hosts
# listed in this parameter also have read access to the agent. Both
# IP addresses and DNS names can be used. Multiple servers can be specified
# in one line, separated by commas. If this parameter used more than
# once, servers listed in all occurences will have access to agent.
#
# Examples:
# ControlServers = 10.0.0.1
# ControlServers = 127.0.0.1, srv1.domain.com, srv2.domain.com

#
# MasterServers
#
# List of management servers which have full access to agent. Hosts listed
# in this group can change agent's config, upload files to agent and initiate
# agent upgrade, as well as perform any task allowed for hosts listed in
# Servers and ControlServers. Both IP addresses and DNS names can be used.
# Multiple servers can be specified in one line, separated by commas.
# If this parameter used more than once, servers listed in all occurences
# will have access to agent.
#
# Examples:
# MasterServers = 10.0.0.1
# MasterServers = 127.0.0.1, srv1.domain.com, srv2.domain.com

#
# ListenPort
#
# Defines the port number for the agent to listen on incoming connections.
# Default values is 4700
#
# Examples:
# ListenPort = 4700

#
# LogFile
#
# Agent's log file. To write log to syslog (or Event Log on Windows),
# use {syslog} as file name.
#
# Examples:
# LogFile = {syslog}
# LogFile = /var/log/nxagentd.log

#
# RequireAuthentication
#
# If set to "yes", host connected to agent have to provide correct shared
# secret before issuing any command. Default value is "no".
#
# Example:
# RequireAuthentication = no

#
# RequireEncryption
#
# If set to "yes", host connected to agent will be forced to use encryption,
# and if encryption is not supported by remote host, connection will be 
# dropped. Default value is "no". This parameter has no effect if agent
# was compiled without encryption support.
#
# Example:
# RequireEncryption = no

#
# EnabledCiphers
#
# Control what ciphers agent can use for connection encryption. Value for
# this parameter is a cipher code. To enable more than one cipher, they
# codes should be added. By default, all possible ciphers are enabled.
#
# Possible cipher codes:
#	1  =  AES-256
#	2  =  BLOWFISH
#	4  =  IDEA
#       8  =  Triple DES
#
# Example (enable AES-256 and IDEA):
# EnabledCiphers = 5

#
# SharedSecret
#
# Agent's shared secret. Used only if RequireAuthentication set to "yes".
#
# Example:
# SharedSecret = secret

#
# MaxSessions
#
# Maximum number of simultaneous communication sessions. Possible value can
# be in range from 2 to 1024. Default value is 32.
#
# Example:
# MaxSessions = 32

#
# SessionIdleTimeout
#
# Communication session's idle timeout in seconds. If agent will not receive
# any command from peer within specified timeout, session will be closed.
# Default value is 60 seconds.
#
# Example:
# SessionIdleTimeout = 60

#
# FileStore
#
# Directory to be used for storing files uploaded by installation server(s).
#
# Example:
# FileStore = /var/nxagentd

#
# TimeOut
#
# GET request timeout in seconds. If GET request cannot be completed for
# specified amount of time, agent will return an error to server.
# Default value is 5 seconds.
#
# Example:
# TimeOut = 5

#
# StartupDelay
#
# Number of seconds agent should wait on startup before start servicing
# requests. This parameter can be useful to prevent false reports about
# missing processes or failed services just after monitored system startup.
# Default value is 0, i.e. no startup delay.
#
# Example:
# StartupDelay = 0

#
# PlatformSuffix
#
# String to be added as suffix to value of System.PlatformName parameter.
#
# Example:
# PlatformSuffix = dbg

#
# EnableSubagentAutoload
#
# Enable or disable autoloading of platform subagent(s).
# Default value is "yes".
#
# Example:
# EnableSubagentAutoload = yes

#
# EnableProxy
#
# Allow requests forwarding
# Default value is "no"
#
# Example:
# EnableProxy = no

#
# EnableSNMPProxy
#
# Allow SNMP requests forwarding
# Default value is "no"
#
# Example:
# EnableSNMPProxy = no

#
# SubAgent
#
# Subagent to load. To load multiple subagents, you should use multiple
# SubAgent parameters. Subagents will be loaded in the same order as they
# appears in configuration file.
#
# UNIX example:
# SubAgent = [path_to_netxms_install_dir]/lib/libnsm_linux.so
#
# Windows example:
# SubAgent = winperf.nsm

#
# ExternalParameter
#
# Add parameter handled by external command. To add multiple parameters, you
# should use multiple ExternalParameter entries. Please note that on Windows
# agent uses system process execution API for execution of specified
# command, so you cannot use pipes or shell commands. If you need to
# execute command via shell, use ExternalParameterShellExec instead.
# 
# Syntax:
# ExternalParameter = <parameter_name>:<command_line>
# If you specify parameter name as "name(*)", then you can use $1 .. $9 in
# command line to substitute actual arguments passed from server.
#
# Examples:
# ExternalParameter = Test:echo test
# ExternalParameter = LineCount(*):cat $1 | wc -l
# ExternalParameter = Test2(*):myprog $1 $2

#
# ExternalParameterShellExec
#
# Add parameter handled by external command. To add multiple parameters, you
# should use multiple ExternalParameterShellExec entries. This is similar
# to ExternalParameter with exception that agent will use shell to execute
# specified command instead of system process exeution API. This difference
# presented only on Windows system, on other systems ExternalParameter and
# ExternalParameterShellExec behaves identically.
# 
# Syntax:
# ExternalParameterShellExec = <parameter_name>:<command_line>
# If you specify parameter name as "name(*)", then you can use $1 .. $9 in
# command line to substitute actual arguments passed from server.
#
# Examples:
# ExternalParameterShellExec = Test:dir c:\ | wc -l
