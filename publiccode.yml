    shortDescription: >-
      Enterprise-grade open-source network and infrastructure monitoring solution.
    longDescription: >
      NetXMS is an open-source network and infrastructure monitoring and
      management solution that provides comprehensive performance and
      availability monitoring with flexible event processing, alerting,
      reporting, and graphing for all layers of IT infrastructure.


      It's a unified solution that can monitor and manage your entire IT
      infrastructure - from network switches to applications - all in one
      place. NetXMS follows a distributed architecture with a central
      management server, monitoring agents, and web/desktop clients. The
      system supports multiple deployment scenarios from single-server
      setups to large distributed environments.


      Key capabilities include automatic network discovery, SNMP monitoring,
      agent-based server/workstation monitoring, real-time log analysis,
      topology-based event correlation, customizable dashboards, and a
      built-in scripting language (NXSL) for advanced automation.
